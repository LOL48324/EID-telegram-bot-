The electrical system comprises an ESP32 microcontroller serving as the central unit, communicating commands from a Telegram bot. Connected to this is a relay module, acting as a switch between the ESP32's low-voltage signals and high-voltage components (electromagnetic lock and UV light). The electromagnetic lock, triggered by the relay, controls access points through electromagnetic locking mechanisms, while the UV light, also relay-controlled, emits ultraviolet light for sterilization or other purposes. Powering the system is a 30000mAh supply, ensuring the lock receives sufficient voltage and current. When a user issues a command via Telegram, the signal is sent via the ethernet to the wifi receiver of the ESP32, then the microchip interprets it and sends the corresponding positive signal to the relay, activating either the lock or UV light as instructed. This setup provides a remote-controlled modularised solution for managing access and light emission to the box at any time, anywhere.
